# swizzle-player
This is a small plugin that allow to change player's swizzle in "Endless Sky" - and keep the colour after ES get updates that change goverments.txt data file.

- Special thanks to James the Bot from "endless Sky" discord forum - for easy way to check swizzle numbers, the bazzilion times I needed to do it in the past.
